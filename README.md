# Password Generator

## Introduction

For this project we were asked to make a password generator. Using JavaScript we needed to satisfy criteria for the password that the user inputed. Using the user input we needed to then randomize characters to create a secure password.

## Password Criteria
- [X] Initiate series of prompts for password criteria
- [X] Length of Password Prompt
- [X] Lowercase Prompt
- [X] Uppercase Prompt
- [X] Numeric Prompt
- [X] Special Character Prompt
- [X] Password tht is generated matches the selected criteria

## Bonus 🏆
> As a bonus I added the ability for users to copy their new password to their clipboard simply by clicking the text box
